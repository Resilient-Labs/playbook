Core Values
===============

Be respectful. Be the type of person who stays positive and gives people the benefit of the doubt.

Give, and do, before being asked. See the best in people. Embrace diversity: of backgrounds, of

perspective, of those things we can choose, and those we can’t. Be accountable. Do with purpose all

that you do. Accept your own failures, and those of your peers, as an important part of the process.

Work hard. Give your all, not just on the stuff that’s fun to do, but also on the stuff that’s not.

***Be Resilient.***
